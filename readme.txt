This webpage serves as my online curriculum vitae.I came up with this idea because 
I realized that having an online resume has a lot of advantages. And these are:

* You don't have to bring a lot of papers when you are applying for a job
* Make your resume stand out
* Once people view my online resume, they could already tell if I'm good at creating websites.
* Instantly accessible
* Its searchable
* It can link out to other social profiles
* Creative
